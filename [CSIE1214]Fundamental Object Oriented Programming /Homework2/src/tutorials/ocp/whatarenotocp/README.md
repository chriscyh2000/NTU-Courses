# What are not OCP

This package demonstrates many examples of which are not OCPs!

## Scenario

A cat has three states: normal, sad and happy <br>
A cat has two actions: sleep and eat

When he is sad, he can't make any actions.


## Design Requirement

The cat should follow OCP on adding/removing his states and actions.


## Another way of thinking OCP

How to extend the **Cat's behaviors** if the Cat **has been compiled**?
