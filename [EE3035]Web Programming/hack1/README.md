## Getting Started (In class)

### 1. Download the problem description slides

* Slides (hack1_problem_description.pdf): [link](https://reurl.cc/aNX319)
* TA will go through it on [Webex Meeting Room](https://ntucc.webex.com/meet/cyhuang) at 9:10am.

### 2. Download the reference code

* [hack1.tgz](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-PlxV_C786hsdfGic-dTUyZ9OrgkAWdZ/view?usp=sharing) | [hack1.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S7n5IhWQtLJ-EbmmN3h5vlF4AF3cHCd1/view?usp=sharing)
* Copy *hack1.tgz* or *hack1.zip* (pick one) to "*wp1101/hack1*" directory and uncompress it there.
* Please note that in some machines you will see that a new directory is created and all the files are uncompressed there. In such case, please move all the files to its parent directory "wp1101/hack1".

### 3. Sign-in Hackathon #1

* Go to this Ceiba Voting event "[In-Class Hackathon #1 Sign in](https://ceiba.ntu.edu.tw/modules/index.php?csn=fdb723&default_fun=vote)"" to vote any option for signing in the in-class hackathon. 
* For signing-out, just push your code to GitHub.

### 4. If you have any question...

* First go to this [Hack#1 Q&As repo](https://github.com/ntuee-webprogramming/hack1-QAs) to check if your question has been asked and answered (in some issue).
* If not, create a new issue with clear title and description.
* Please refer to this tutorial for the usage of GitHub issue (https://bit.ly/3bbIfc0).

### 5. If you encounter a personal issue/problem that cannot be resolved in GitHub issue...
* You can TAG a TA or express your need in GitHub issue, and **TA will invite you** to his/her Google Meet for online Q&As. 
* **PLEASE DO NOT GO TO TA's Google Meet WITHOUT TA's INVITATION!!**

### 6. Announcements during the Hackathon
* Please follow this [FB post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/NTURicWebProg/posts/1511691302512118/) (will also announce on Ceiba)

### 7. Testing your code:
* We will use "cypress" to automatically test and grade your code, so you are advised to install "cypress" in advance so that you can run automatic tests during the tests. 
* If you fail to install, please resolve it ASAP. However, if you really can't install it on your computer due to machine, OS version, or some other issues, it is OK. You can still manually test your codes by referring to our test program in the reference code. TAs will test your code in their own machines so this won't be an issue -- Just make sure you name the variables/classes/IDs exactly the same as defined in the problem description.


### 8. Webex Meeting Room is for emergency announcement only during the hackathon.
* It will/should be remain silent after the problem introduction.
