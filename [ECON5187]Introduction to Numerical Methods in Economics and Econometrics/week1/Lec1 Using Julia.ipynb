    "# Composing and Running Julia\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to run Julia command is launching Julia REPL and typing commands into it.\n",
    "- REPL: read-evaluate-print loop; a command-line based interface.\n",
    "- Launch it by typing `julia` in Command Prompt (_dos box_) or by clicking `julia.exe`.\n",
    "- Good for testing or running short commands.\n",
    "- May also execute Julia scripts; see below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for most of the jobs, we often need to write Julia commands and programs in a file, and execute the file to obtain results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Julia files (those containing Julia commands and programs) can be edited in two formates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### simple Julia scripts (`*.jl`)\n",
    "- Julia scripts are plain text (instead of binary) files containing Julia commands. They can be opened and edited in any ASCII editors, such as Notepad, Notepad++, or via an IDE (integrated development environment) such as VSCode and Juno. \n",
    "  - An IDE provides an array of tools that assist coding. For instance, the tools include code editors, syntax highlighting, debuggers, and the ability to integrate a server or a kernel.\n",
    "- VSCode, being an IDE, integrates an editor and a Julia REPL (_the engine_) together. So, you could edit and run Julia scripts in VSCode.\n",
    "- You could also edit the `*.jl` in Notepad (non-IDE) and run the script in an independent Julia REPL.\n",
    "  - You may have to change to the working directory by, for instance, `cd(\"c:\\\\class\\\\homework\")` (or, `cd(\"c:/class/homework\")`).\n",
    "  - Then, you run the script by `include(\"your_script_name.jl\")`.\n",
    "- Recommended for long and serious jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Jupyter Notebooks (`*.ipynb`)  (_**This is what we use for lectures and homeworks.**_)\n",
    "- The notebook is also a text file (in JSON format) but it's almost impossible to humanly edit it.\n",
    "- Instead, we launch the Jupyter Notebook (which is essentially a web application) in computers and create-edit-and-run the `.ipynb` documents with it. Alternatively, you may also edit and run a `.ipynb` document in VSCode.  \n",
    "- The notebook could load Julia kernels and thus we can execute Julia commands directly from the notebook.  \n",
    "  - It makes Jupyter Notebook looks like an IDE, but strictly speaking it is not (yet). It does not provide a full range of tools that we mentioned above.\n",
    "- The notebook has two types of cells.\n",
    "  - A **code cell** contains code to be executed in the kernel. When the code is run, the notebook displays the output below the code cell that generated it.\n",
    "  - A **Markdown cell** contains text formatted using Markdown and displays its output in-place when the Markdown cell is run.\n",
    "  - Markdown is a text formatting syntax designed for writing in the internet. There are tons of tutorials on the Markdown language; just google it. A nice example is [here](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/the-ultimate-markdown-guide-for-jupyter-notebook-d5e5abf728fd).\n",
    "- The mixture of commands and texts make it ideal for teaching and documentations. It is also good for prototype code and for exploratory studies.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Another way to summarize\n",
    "\n",
    "- Plain editors (like Notepad) can edit Julia scripts (`*.jl`);\n",
    "- Julia REPL can run `*.jl` scripts;\n",
    "- IDEs (like VSCode) and edit and run `*.jl` scripts.   \n",
    "- Jupyter Notebook, though not quite an IDE, can edit and run `*.ipynb` files.\n",
