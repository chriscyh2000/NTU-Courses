    "# Homework on Accept-Reject Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $X$ is a random variable that follows a half-normal distribution $N^+(0,2)$. Write an accept-reject program that uses the exponential distribution $Exp(2)$ as the proposal distribution to draw samples from $X$. The challenge is to find the value of `m`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Draw the density plots of $X$ and $Exp(2)$ to visually inspect the distributions. What is the range in the values of $X$ that `m` is most likely to occur?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Write a program that calculates `m`. \n",
    "Hint: An _exact_ solution may be difficult and so an approximated value is enough. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Write an accept-reject sampling program for $X$ and use it to draw a random sample of 100,000 values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Draw a histogram of the sample and overlay it with the theoretical density. Calculate the mean and the variance of the sample and compare them to the theoretical values. Are they close?"
